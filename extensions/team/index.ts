/**
 * team — a Lead in pi running a Team of Claude Code Teammates on one Effort.
 *
 * This file is wiring and nothing else. Teams, Roles and Playbooks are read
 * and checked by `definitions.ts`; what `/team start` says is decided by
 * `start.ts`; an Effort's state is folded and stepped by `core.ts`, and its
 * files are kept by `records.ts`; the `claude` executable is known only to
 * `claude.ts`.
 *
 * Every path root is injected through {@link TeamDeps}, so tests point the
 * extension at temp folders and a fake `claude`, and nothing reaches the
 * human's real agent dir or Claude Code config.
